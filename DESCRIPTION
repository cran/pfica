Description: Performs smoothed (and non-smoothed) principal/independent components analysis
  of functional data. Various functional pre-whitening approaches are implemented as 
  discussed in Vidal and Aguilera (2022) “Novel whitening approaches in functional 
  settings", <doi:10.1002/sta4.516>. Further whitening representations of functional 
  data can be derived in terms of a few principal components, providing an avenue 
  to explore hidden structures in low dimensional settings: see Vidal,
  Rosso and Aguilera (2021) “Bi-smoothed functional independent component 
  analysis for EEG artifact removal”, <doi:10.3390/math9111243>.
